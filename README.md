# HaskellBook

My solutions to the exercises from Chris Allen's "Haskell Programming From First Principles". I put them here only as a means of comparing your own solutions to gain some insights. I suggest you only consult this after finishing the exercises yourself. Suggestions, bugs and potential improvements are more then welcome (opening an issue is probably the easiest).
